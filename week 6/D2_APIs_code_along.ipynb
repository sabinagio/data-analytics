    "Storing an API key directly in your code can expose sensitive information, especially if your code is publicly available (e.g., on a public GitHub repository). The best practice for saving and loading an API key in your code involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storing the API Key**:\n",
    "    - **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key in an environment variable on your system. This keeps the key out of your codebase and allows you to change it without altering your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Create a .env File**: If you prefer, you can create a `.env` file (just call it `.env` nothing else before the `.`) in your project directory to store the API key. Inside this file, you would have something like:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Add .env to .gitignore**: If you're using a version control system like Git, make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file. This prevents the `.env` file (and therefore your API key) from being uploaded to any public repositories. We'll talk about Git and .gitignore in more detail soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Key in Your Code**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use libraries like `python-dotenv` to load the key into your code. \n",
    "    You would need to install `python-dotenv` first.\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    !pip install python-dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "    from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    load_dotenv()\n",
    "    api_key = os.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Now, `api_key` contains the value of your API key, and you can use it to authenticate your requests to the API.\n",
