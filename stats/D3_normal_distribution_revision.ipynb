    "> Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of **how likely an event is to occur**, or **how likely it is that a proposition is true**. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.
